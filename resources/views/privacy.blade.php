                                    We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to the Company so whether you are new to the Company or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <strong>Information we collect</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We collect information to provide better services to all of our users.

                                    We collect information in two ways:
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an account on our Website. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong> We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</li>
                                    <li><strong>Device information</strong> We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). The Company may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your personal account.
                                    <li><strong>Log information</strong> When you use our services or view content provided by the Company, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries;</li>
                                            <li>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls;</li>
                                            <li>Internet protocol address;</li>
                                            <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL; and/or</li>
                                            <li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Location information</strong> When you use a location-enabled Company service, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Unique application numbers</strong> Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your Website use (for example, the operating system type or an application version number) may be sent to the Company when you install or uninstall a particular Company service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Local storage</strong> We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</strong> When you visit our Website, we use various technologies to collect and store personal information. Such technologies may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Company features that may appear on other sites.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                    We use the information we collect from our Website to provide, maintain, improve, and to develop new services; to protect the Company; and, to protect and better serve our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We may use the name you provide for your profile across all of the services we offer that require an account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible profile information, such as your name and a photo.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    When you contact the Company, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Company services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know or other users. We will not combine double click cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Please note, we may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <strong>Transparency and choice</strong>
                                </p>

                                    People have different privacy concerns. So that you can make meaningful choices about how your information is used by our Company, our goal is to be as clear and transparent about the information we collect as possible. For example, on the Website you can:
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>review and control certain types of information tied to your account;</li>
                                    <li>use our editor  to see and adjust how your profile appears to particular individuals;</li>
                                    <li>control  who you share information with; and/or</li>
                                    <li>take information  out of many of our services.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                    You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services.  Further, you can set your browser to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. It is important to remember, however, that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <strong>Information you share</strong>

                                <p>
                                    Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines and other companies (including our own).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <strong>Accessing and updating your personal information</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or are extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
                                </p>

                                    We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.
